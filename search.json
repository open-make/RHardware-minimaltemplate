    "text": "Background\nAfter analyzing open source hardware documentation and existing templates (see below and 9  Sources), we are convinced that (1) documentation should grow with the different phases of a project and (2) the documentation should not restrict itself to the technical documentation necessary to reproduce the hardware, but should have a larger scope: the goal is not only to make the hardware (re-)producible, but to facilitate collaborative work in the development of the hardware (see Fig below).\n\n\n\nHardware project documentation is diverse, it grows with project development (depicted by orange boxes from left to right: ideation, specification, concept development, prototyping), and go beyond the technical documentation (black box)\n\n\nAccordingly, we created both a template for hardware project and this guide. We hope to facilitate the creation of hardware project documentation with these two tools.",

    "text": "Rational\nOpen source hardware projects documentation can be divided in at least two activities: documenting the product (manufacturing, assembly, use, maintenance and so on.) and documenting the process (project vision, collaborators, how to collaborate, design process). This distinction can also be linked with the five OSHWA defined freedom for OSH: study, modify being mostly related to the process; make, distribute, and sell being mostly related to the product.\nOn the other hand, an hardware project goes through several development steps, each of them deserving some specific documentation. In the ideation phase, one should define the project vision and find collaborators. In the needs analysis phase, the team is documenting their research on the definition of requirements and on the related existing projects. In the concept phase, the team is describing some implementation possibilities. In the prototyping phase, the team is iteratively designing a prototype, the product documentation is starting now, while the process documentation may be expanded as new collaborators comes in. In the replicator phase, the prototype is moved to a market-ready product, and the documentation aimed at users and producers of hardware will become more important.",

Some elements of the guide are not in the template, because the elements should best be organised via a different repository and linked in the readme (software, data, educational resources)\nBecause we expect most project to see this template when already having a prototype, we added a special chapter on starting documentation at this stage (Document when you already have a prototype).",

Especially, the analysis of “Similar projects” coming in step 3, and the prototyping (step 4) are often giving new ideas and refining use cases. The vision may change when new team members enter the project, independently of the development stage.\n\nWhat is the minimal documentation? My project is tiny.\n\nThe size of the project is not really affecting the number of elements that are important, it will affect the size of each element, though.\nWhile you may tend to skip the community aspects of the documentation, we think these are important aspects of the development process, unless you really want to do it alone.\n\nWhy is the technical documentation description so small?\n\nTechnical documentation will be very different depending on the hardware created, we only gave general hints in this guide. As a rule of thumb, developing a hardware collaboratively with at least one other human will help you define how to organise the technical documentation.\n\nWhen should I start documenting?\n\nAs soon as possible. This template allows you to start documenting your project at the ideation phase. While it might seem too early, it is useful when you want to present your ideas to collect feedback or even find collaborators. This allows to make clearer what are the important aspects of your idea, and can start interesting discussions.",

Usually, an hardware project follows different stages of development, which may be seen as particular milestones where the team check that they gathered enough information and documented their process, before going to the next stage.\nThe guide propose 5 stages of developement: - ideation - specification (needs analysis) - concept development - protoyping - replication phase\nWhen some ideas to address a particular need are tested, the process is called prototyping. After many iterations and testing, a prototype will be selected for further development. The design that solves the needs but is not yet complete nor ready to be replicated (usually because some parts are not well documented or requires a lot of manual adjustments) is called a demonstrator. When the design and documentation are polished and are ready to be used by hardware producers, the hardware is usually labeled as a market-ready product.",

Most of the advantages of documenting the project exhaustively will then be obsolete, and authors may want to restrict the document to its essentials.\nAs explained in the FAQ though, all elements may be important and we encourage everyone to go through each steps (even rapidely), making short description of what they had in mind when developing the project so far. These descriptions may be shorter than what you would have written if done earlier, but it may be important to ask these different questions, even when the project seems quite advanced. So, our advice is to look at the checklists of each step also when you have a prototype. You may want to use the provided template “Full_Project_prototype”, going rapidly through it to get to some documentation done fast.\nThere are different degrees for how open an OSH project can be, but every step in this direction is welcome and an opportunity to contribute to better research and open new career paths.\nThe process may help you to refine the scope of your project, potentially help you find your users and facilitate discussions with other contributors or investors.",

In the past, different OSH projects have included different partners at varying stages of their development. On top of user and contributor roles that OSH have in common with open source software, local or global hardware manufacturers may become important partners of your project. You may also think early about the people who will eventually have to maintain and repair (and recycle) the hardware.\nIt also helps to make your hardware designs modular (splitting your hardware in modules which may have alternative designs). Another specificity of hardware may be the importance of the creation of replication tutorials, workshops, seminars, or training materials (Section 2.6), which can impact the adoption of hardware designs. This is particularly relevant if the OSH is meant to be produced in Do-It-Yourself environments or as a teaching opportunity.\nIt is important to decide whether, when and where you want to engage with, or build a community. Most OSH communities are local in comparison to open source software project. You may not have the time or skills to build a community, and your project may not need a community to flourish.\nDocumentation which may help build a community can range from a simple note on the work culture in the readme, toward a full, implemented code of conduct and community guidelines, as well as a governance structure, on ways to interact and take decisions in the community.\nDescribe what opportunities for collaboration different members will have.

Allow informed discussions when a particular project design has reached the end or when it is useful to update it for efficiency and sustainability.\nA leadership structure in an open project should aim to empower others and develop agency and accountability in your community. You can start by listing different tasks within your project and inviting your members to lead those tasks. Provide appropriate incentives and acknowledgment for the contributions made by your community members. Create opportunities for members to share some leadership responsibilities with you in the project. When inviting suggestions and ideas from the community, provide the first set of plans where your community can develop from.\nMore information:\n\nhttps://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/\nhttps://book.the-turing-way.org/ethical-research/ethics-open-source-governance\n\n\nSources\nSection 9.5",

(See actors analysis, Section 4.8).\nAt the intermediate and lowest levels of a functional breakdown (white box view), technical functions are input-output relationships transforming matter, energy or information flows. They are expressing in a non-solution neutral way and observable from inside the product. A set of technical functions is necessary for the realization of a service function (in contrast to solution neutral expression of the capabilities, Section 4.3).\n\n\nWhy should you define functional model?\n\nA functional model helps to break down a complicated problem into simple sub-problems.\nA functional model helps to anticipate failures occurring when an intended effect of the product is no longer produced on its environment.\nA function is the main input to derive the functional requirements required to define the conditions of use of the product as well as to provide objective evidences through the validation and verification activities.\n\n\n\nHow to document a functional model?\n\nThe documentation of technical functions, which requires adopting an internal (white box) viewpoint on the product, consists in breaking down the service function into sub-functions. The decomposition process is no more solution neutral as it requires to make a decision at every indenture level. The functional decomposition requires two modelling approaches: function tree and functional graph.\n\nSee also Section 5.3 for the technical description of creating trees and graphs.\n\nFunctional tree\nThe functional tree is a top-down decomposition of function into sub-functions that helps to simplify the problem to solve.\nThe decomposition of technical functions creates a functional tree and, the technical functions are defined based on the functional requirements.\n\nA top-down and bottom-up reading of the functional tree provides insight on the “how” and “why”, respectively.\nThe decomposition process should be stopped when the technical function is sufficiently detailed to reuse, make, or buy a design solution.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nImage of functional tree of XYZ cargo-ADD ONS\n\n\n\n\n1. What minimum documentation should the functional tree provide?\n- A model specifying the kinds of technical functions and their sub\n-functions in the format of a tree.\n\nHow to implement the functional tree?\n\n\nUse functional modeling language for representation, such as\n\nUML (Use Case diagram)\nSysML (Block Definition, Activity, or Internal Block diagram)\nSADT/IDEF0\nFunctional flow block diagram\n\nUse open-source software for modeling the tree representation, such as:\n\ndraw.io (diagram.net)\nexcalidraw\nPapyrus\nModelio\nCapella\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional graph\nThe functional graph is a multi-level logical articulation of technical functions. - Relationships between functions are in/out-going flows of matter, energy, or information. - Logical AND/OR gates can be used to define concurrent or sequential functions. - Articulation of technical function can describe as input-output relationships transforming flows by using the functional modeling language in the format of the graph\n\nExample\n The image shows the functional graph of the relationship between technical functions for maintaining food quality by ADD-ONS of XYZ cargo.\n\nSee Section 5.3 for information about creating tree and graph\n\n\nWhat minimum documentation should the functional graph provide?\n\nA model specifying a multi-level logic of relationships between technical functions (refer to functional graph of XYZ Cargo-ADD ONS)\n\nHow to implement the functional tree?\n\nUse functional modeling language for representation, such as\ndraw.io (diagram.net)\nexcalidraw\nUML (Use Case diagram)\nSysML (Block Definition, Activity, or Internal Block diagram)\nSADT/IDEF0\nFunctional flow block diagram\n\n\n\nUse open-source software for modeling the tree representation, such as\n\nPapyrus\nModelio\nCapella\n\n\n\n\nThe link below shows an example of functional block diagrams of an open-source project\nFunctional diagram of Renesas ventilator\n\n\nSources\nSection 9.1",

Since software/firmware development follows different practices that often needs a more detailed version control system, they are usually developed independently of the hardware.\nAny code or firmware required to operate the hardware should be shared. This will allow others to use it with their hardware or modify it along with their modifications to your hardware. Document the process required to build your software, including links to any dependencies (for example, third-party libraries or tools). In addition, it is helpful to provide an overview of the state of the software (for example, “stable” or “beta” or “barely-working hack”).\nIn all cases, it is important to keep track of which version of the soft/firmwares are used with which version of the hardware.\nAlso indicate details on the operating software and programming language, and include minimum version compatibility, and dditional system requirements, like memory, disk space, processor, input or output devices.\n\nExample: the airtrack hardware: https://codeberg.org/openmake/airtrack-hardware, software: https://github.com/open-make/code-airtrack\n\nThe Airtrack hardware was developed using pixycam. The hardware and the software are developed in different repositories with different people involved. In 2025, as the pixycam was not produced anymore, a new version of the hardware was created, using the pixycam2 component. This had little effects on the hardware design, but, the firmware and software needed to be modified.\n\n\nSources\nSection 9.1, Section 9.3",

If you do not have photos, posting annotated 3D renderings of your design is a good alternative. Either way, it is good to provide captions or text that explain what is shown in each image and why it is useful.\nThe Assembly sequence usually start with a description and list of each part that will be assembled, and then provide a step-by-step guide. One can think of instruction for lego objects (In these special case, the part list is identical to a BOM and placed at the end).\nSee Chapter 6 for information about software and dependence with guide for manufacturing.\n\nPart list\nThe Part list for mechanical parts is a complete list of all parts needed to build the complete product. It is different from the BOM which list material needed for the manufacture of the parts, while this document list the manufactured parts.\nIt constitutes of : - Item numbers: are based on the assembly structure, that is, the order in which parts are displayed in assembly. - Part number or drawing number: which is a reference back to the detail drawing (refer to the BOM). - Description: is usually a part name or a complete description of parts. - Quantity is the number of that particular part used on this assembly. - Image (or STL render) of each part.\n\n\nSequence\nThe set of steps necessary to properly assemble the parts should be well described at each step.\n\nThe joining technology at each step should be clearly described: - Screwing - Bolting - Soldering - Gluing (or “gluing and screwing”)\n\n\nExample\nPoppy Robot\nJPL Open Source Rover\nSatNOGS Rotator v3 , Assembly instructions\nOpen Source Powered Prosthetic Leg\n\n\n\nNotes\nIt is good practice to design the parts such that the assembly is easier.

This will enhance the usability of the hardware or method in other contexts.\n\nExample: Ink Printers usually have a testing mode where a specific data file is used where the printed output will inform the user about the accuracy of the printer.
