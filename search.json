    "text": "The vision provides details about the project ultimate goal, its specificity and main objectives: what, for whom and why do we have this project.\nIt serves to give meaning to the whole endeavor and is a representation of what we want to achieve. It may also present the problem the project aims at solving.\nIt addresses the question: Why are you starting this project?\nExamples:\n\nThe OpenFlexure project makes high precision mechanical positioning available to anyone with a 3D printer - for use in microscopes, micromanipulators, and more.\n\n\nThis projects aims at providing fablabs and makerspaces with pedal powered toolkit, in order to open discussions around the principles of low technologies: especially questioning needs (do we need the object), and designing while recognizing the ecological impact (choice of material, improving durability and repairability).\nOne single pedal “motor” will be connected with several tools usually requiring a rotating motor (sewing machine, saw, …). The main goal is to question the use of electrical power and show the simplicity of the tool in fablabs. The multi-functionality is important for the concept of sufficiency (less resources for a similar output). An additional goal may be to enhance collaborative work (one need two people to use the tools).\nWe think this may also help solves the problem of “building fancy but useless objects” we sometimes see in fablabs, when objects are build to show one’s skill and the possibilities of the machines, but they do not answer any needs.\n\n\nThe project BCN3D Moveo is motivated by the high cost of the materials that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer mechatronics systems.",
