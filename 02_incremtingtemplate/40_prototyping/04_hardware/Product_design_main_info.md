# Hardware documentation

The hardware is divided into different parts, each part is described with its own manufacturing and assembly manual.

This file gives information about the whole hardware (and its versions), to ease the process of manufacturing and assembling the whole thing.

Note: if you are using Gitbuilding, or another specific software to create this guide, 
you may organise your documentation differently.

## Version 1: title

- BOM
- skills and machines needed to build
- structural design summary and specificity
- software/firmware availability
- final assembly instructions
