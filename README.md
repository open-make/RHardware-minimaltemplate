# Vision: a template for OSH projects

In this repository, we are building templates for elements of an open source hardware project.
The aim is to facilitate the work of designers, helping them to easily create the documentation at the right time.

# How to use this template

This repository has one folder for each steps in the hardware projects, including elements that may or should be added to the documentation, and a checklist is provided to be able to follow the process.
The documenter may simply start by coping the 01_ideation folder, and change content where asked.
When finised, the checklist will help them find elements of each other folder they want to add, until they reach the documentation meant for the maturity of their project.

> *Example*: Max has a first prototype already.
> He starts its documentation with the idea description, add the analysis of needs, then the concept development files.
> Finally, he is adding the product documentation related to its prototype.
> By asking for feedback along the process, Max did realize the ideation documentation is extremely helpful to present the project, especially outside his first collaborators circle and more people showed interest in the project.
> By making some requirement more explicit, Max could derive specific needs and therefore specific hardware functionalities the first prototype is lacking, Max hopes to find better solutions in the next prototype iteration.
> One year later, Max is leaving the project, but the project still lives as new maintainers with the same vision are developing it further.

# Project history and rational

Open source hardware projects documentation can be divided in at least two activities: documenting the product (manufacturing, assembly, use, maintenance and so on.) and documenting the process (project vision, collaborators, how to collaborate, design process).
This distinction can also be linked with the five [OSHWA defined freedom for OSH](https://freedomdefined.org/OSHW): **study**, **modify** being mostly related to the process; **make**, **distribute,** and **sell** being mostly related to the product.

On the other hand, an hardware project goes through several development steps, each of them deserving some specific documentation.
In the **ideation** phase, one should define the project vision and find collaborators.
In the **needs analysis** phase, the team is documenting their research on the definition of requirements and on the related existing projects.
In the **concept** phase, the team is describing some implementation possibilities.
In the **prototyping** phase, the team is iteratively designing a prototype, the product documentation is starting now, while the process documentation may be expanded as new collaborators comes in.
In the **replicator** phase, the prototype is moved to a market-ready product, and the documentation aimed at users and producers of hardware will become more important.

## Growing documentation with project size

Using analyses of at several examples of hardware and software project, we derived a large amount of elements that may be included in an hardware project.
We then categorizing them following their goal (process or product documentation) and indicated whether it should be created or updated at different stage of development.

From this we created a miminal template for the ideation stage, and provide a checklist of additional elements to add.
Templates for each additional elements are also provided.

# Roadmap and future work

We plan on providing template files and good guidelines in November 2024.
Then, we plan on testing them in specific projects (internal and external).\
In the future, we hope to build some software to help with the additions instead of using a checklist.
