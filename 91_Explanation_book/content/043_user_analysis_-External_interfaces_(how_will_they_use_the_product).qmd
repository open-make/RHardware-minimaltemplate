## User analysis: External interfaces  {#sec-user-analysis-external-interfaces}

External interfaces (how will the product be used) are interactions between the product and the actors (including target users).

-   An interface has a direction (in, out, or in-out)
-   An interface is made of a flow (matter, energy, or signal)
