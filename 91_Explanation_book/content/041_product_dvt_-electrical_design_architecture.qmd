# Electrical architecture {#sec-electrical-architecture}

The architectural structure is a physical or logical layout of the components of a system design and their internal and external connections.

1.  What minimum documentation should the architectural structure provide?

    -   A model specifying the kind of components and their sub-components in the format of a tree or a graph including
        -   DC motor
        -   A/D converter
        -   DC converters\
        -   Rotor
        -   Sensor system
        -   Motherboard
        -   kit
        -   Resistor
        -   Transistors
        -   IC
        -   Sensors
        -   Etc.

See \@sec-structural-model for information about how to document this.
Provide both an image and the editable files, as well as instruction how to use them.

## Details and editable format: PCB design

To reuse a electrical design, it should provide information consist of:

1.  Preferable file format

-   Editable file formats that could be:
    -   Source formats such as .gbr, .lib format\
    -   Neutral formats such as Kicad_mod, kicad_pcb

2.  Preferable open-source software

-   Tiny CAD
-   KiCAD
-   ADINA
