## Electrical architecture {#sec-electrical-architecture}

The architectural structure is a physical or logical layout of the components of a system design and their internal and external connections.

1.  What minimum documentation should the architectural structure provide?

    -   A model specifying the kind of components and their sub-components in the format of a tree or a graph including
        -   DC motor
        -   A/D converter
        -   DC converters\
        -   Rotor
        -   Sensor system
        -   Motherboard
        -   kit
        -   Resistor
        -   Transistors
        -   IC
        -   Sensors
        -   Etc.

See @sec-how-to-document-models for information about how to document this.
Provide both an image and the editable files, as well as instruction how to use them.
