## Step 2 Needs analysis


Using a open source hardware canva to analyse the project may be useful at this point (defining users, contributors, communication channels, resources required).


A lot of the user analysis and the problem description part aims at the definition of the constrains and requirements for the hardware which is included in the product development part of the documentation.

It may also be time to work on community engagement.
