## Validation {#sec-validation}

> How do you know the hardware works ?

Elaborate how the hardware technically/methodologically advances the state-of-the-art, including references to relevant research articles and online references.

This may be important for future development, as new validation cycles would probably build on this documentation.
Indicate any sofware/code used for validation of the design.
