## User Guides - Overview of the hardware {#sec-user-guides-overview-of-the-hardware}

including:

```         
-   Device name (and its parts) and their definition
-   Essentials and technical specifications
```

One can describe examples of application of the hardware. This should include some evidence of output, like data produced by the use of the device or a picture of other types of results. Outline how the quality control in @sec-user-guides-troubleshooting enables the use of the hardware in this context. We encourage the link to experiment results or the reference to a publication (published or to be published) where these results are detailed. We also encourage pointers to ongoing work.
