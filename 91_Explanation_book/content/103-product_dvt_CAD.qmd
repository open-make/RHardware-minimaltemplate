# product dvt - Design models

## Providing the design

Model design should be provided in a format that can be used to manufacture each piece (usually STL file for 3D and SVG file for 2D design).


## Modelling a design in an editable file format 

 
An editable file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage and allows the makers to study, modify the geometry of a model and reuse it.


To reuse a design model, it should provide information consist of:

 1. Preferable 3D/2D file format
   - Editable file formats that could be:
     - Native formats such as .FCStd format of FreeCAD 
     - Neutral formats such as STEP files
 2. Preferable open-source software 
   - OpensCAD
   - Inkscape
   - FreeCAD

- **Definition:** *The characteristics of the materials are those that identify the reactions of materials reactions to heat, electricity, light, force, etc.* 

  - *Selection of materials  based on factors including properties for [behavioral](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_template/tree/main/Documentation/3.%20Design/Behavioral%20model) analysis, [environmental impact](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_Guideline-for-documentation-of-OSH-design-reuse/tree/main/Documentation/8.%20Disposal), [manufacturing](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/wp2.3_template/tree/main/Documentation/4.%20Manufacturing) processes in design reuse.* 

```
  The material characteristics of mechanical parts consist of: 
  
  1- Identifying the kind of characteristics and their properties: 
  
    - Mechanical characteristics like hardness, elasticity, plasticity, toughness, etc. 
    - Manufacturing properties like castability, machinability rating, etc.
    - Thermal characteristics like melting point, thermal conductivity, etc.
    - Electrical characteristics like electrical resistivity and conductibility, etc.
    - Chemical properties like corrosion resistance, surface tension, etc.
