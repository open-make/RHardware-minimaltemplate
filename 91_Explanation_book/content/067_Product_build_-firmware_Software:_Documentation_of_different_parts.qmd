## Product build -firmware/Software {#sec-product-build-firmwaresoftware}

Here comes the elements that were more briefly described in @sec-software-and-firmware-architecture.
Since software/firmware development follows different practices that often needs a more detailed version control system, they are usually developed independently of the hardware.

In all cases, it is important to keep track of which version of the soft/firmwares are used with which version of the hardware.

Also indicate details on the operating software and programming language, and include minimum version compatibility, and dditional system requirements, like memory, disk space, processor, input or output devices.


> Example: the airtrack hardware: <https://codeberg.org/openmake/airtrack-hardware>, software: <https://github.com/open-make/code-airtrack>\
> \
> The Airtrack hardware was developed using pixycam.
> The hardware and the software are developed in different repositories with different people involved.
> In 2025, as the pixycam was not produced anymore, a new version of the hardware was created, using the pixycam2 component.
> This had little effects on the hardware design, but, the firmware and software needed to be modified.
