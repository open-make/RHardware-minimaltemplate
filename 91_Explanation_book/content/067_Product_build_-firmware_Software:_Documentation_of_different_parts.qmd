# Product build -firmware/Software {#sec-product-build-firmwaresoftware}

Here comes the elements that were more briefly described in @sec-software-and-firmware-architecture.
Since software/firmware development follows different practices that often needs a more detailed version control system, they are usually developed independently of the hardware.

In all cases, it is important to keep track of which version of the soft/firmwares are used with which version of the hardware.

> Example: the airtrack hardware: <https://codeberg.org/openmake/airtrack-hardware>, software: <https://github.com/open-make/code-airtrack>\
> \
> The Airtrack hardware was developed using pixycam.
> The hardware and the software are developed in different repositories with different people involved.
> In 2025, as the pixycam was not produced anymore, a new version of the hardware was created, using the pixycam2 component.
> This had little effects on the hardware design, but, the firmware and software needed to be modified.
