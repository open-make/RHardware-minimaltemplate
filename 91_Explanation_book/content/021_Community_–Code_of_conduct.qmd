Add an Open Source Project Codes of Conduct to your project, see https://opensourceconduct.com/ for examples

-   This document should not be used as a token, it is very important to put intentional effort into it.

-   List the expected and unacceptable behaviors, describe the reporting and enforcement process, explicitly define the scope, and use an inclusive tone.

-   Whenever you update your code of conduct, invite comments from your members to ensure that their concerns are addressed.
