> From the start it has been a collaborative effort where everyone works together to make a working solution.
> By **summer 2012** we had built 18-port switches and used the [SPEC](https://gitlab.com/ohwr/project/spec/-/wikis) hardware as end nodes and had made a demonstration program where one could see that the WR protocol lived up to its promises.
