## Product Build: Bill of material {#sec-product-build-bill-of-material}

A bill of materials (BOM) is a comprehensive list of parts, items, and other materials required to create a product, as well as instructions required for gathering and using the required materials.
If the component is to be purchased, one should find all the information required to buy the part.
If the part is to be manufactured, one should find all the descriptions of the manufacturing instructions as described below.

A bill of material usually includes:

1.  Part number
2.  Item name
3.  Manufacturer part number
4.  Digi-Key part number
5.  Description
6.  Manufactured part (link to manufacturing instruction)
7.  Purchased part (link to seller website)
8.  Quantity
9.  Price
10. Manufacturing standard lead time
11. Packaging instruction
12. BOM notes

## Modularisation

When there are multiple parts, it is best practice to have a BOM for each part, and one BOM for the whole hardware.
For complex project, it is therefore best to create BOM automatically.
Some software are meant to created BOM from the CAD files (CAD-coupled documentation, <https://doi.org/10.5334/joh.56>) or from the assembly instruction (using [Gitbuilding](https://gitbuilding.io)).
