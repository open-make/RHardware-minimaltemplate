## Vision and motivation {#sec-vision-and-motivation}

The vision provides details about the project ultimate goal, its
specificity and main objectives: what, for whom and why do we have this
project.

It serves to give meaning to the whole endeavor and is a representation
of what we want to achieve. It may also present the problem the project
aims at solving.

It addresses the question: Why are you starting this project?

Examples:

> The OpenFlexure project makes high precision mechanical positioning
> available to anyone with a 3D printer - for use in microscopes,
> micromanipulators, and more.

> This projects aims at providing fablabs and makerspaces with pedal
> powered toolkit, in order to open discussions around the principles of
> [low technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_technology):
> especially questioning needs (do we need the object), and designing
> while recognizing the ecological impact (choice of material, improving
> durability and repairability).
>
> One single pedal "motor" will be connected with several tools usually
> requiring a rotating motor (sewing machine, saw, ...). The main goal
> is to question the use of electrical power and show the simplicity of
> the tool in fablabs. The multi-functionality is important for the
> concept of sufficiency (less resources for a similar output). An
> additional goal may be to enhance collaborative work (one need two
> people to use the tools).
>
> We think this may also help solves the problem of "building fancy but
> useless objects" we sometimes see in fablabs, when objects are build
> to show one's skill and the possibilities of the machines, but they do
> not answer any needs.

> The project BCN3D Moveo is motivated by the high cost of the materials
> that undergraduate students must use for learning how to engineer
> mechatronics systems.
