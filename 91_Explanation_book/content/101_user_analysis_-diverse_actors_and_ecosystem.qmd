## Diverse actors and ecosystem

`this is sometimes refered to a "stakeholder analysis", but we avoided that term in this template.`

The ecosystem generally refer to all the actors (human and non-human) who (may) have an interest in a product. Among them, there are both internal players, such as users and participants of the project, and external players that are represented by the potential user of products or external entities.


  - It is not necessarily a person (for example: airports as an actor when designing a two-deck aircraft).
  - They can indirectly affect, be affected by the product (for example: neighborhood or biodiversity when designing an airport).
  
The ecosystem is often best represented via a graphics or a mindmap. This analysis may be necessary to make design choice that will fit the ecosystem inside which the hardware is supposed to work.

NB: The user target groups is one of these actors and should be determined with more accuracy, it is defined more extensively elsewhere.
