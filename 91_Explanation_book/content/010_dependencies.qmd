## dependencies

Here it is welcome to acknowledge the existing sources that have been used in this project with locations, and name their initiators. At best, present dependencies following what these projects provide as citation information. But at least:

-   Initiators of the original project

-   URL of the original project

    You may also cite projects that project is citing as dependencies or source, with the URL of other related projects

These dependencies can be hardware or software projects, modular components, libraries, or frameworks. You may indicate information on version compatibilities. You should explicitly state if dependencies are proprietary / closed source.
