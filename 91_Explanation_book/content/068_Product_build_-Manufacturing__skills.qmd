### Product build: Manufacturing tool {#sec-product-build-manufacturing-tools}

Manufacturing tools means all the machinery, equipment, and processes used to manufacture products.
Manufacturing technology guide to find the type of necessary technology to produce the part.
In that case, it should describe the most suitable technology according to the context.

### Type of machines

Type of machines used

1.  CNC machine tools for machining metal or other rigid materials
    -   Milling

    -   Lathe

    -   Cutting

    -   Drilling
2.  Other common manufacturing tools
    -   3D printing (FDM, SLS...)
    -   Thermoforming
    -   Burning machining technology (laser cutting, Plasma cutting, ...)
    -   Bonding technologies (Solder, cold welding, arc welding, adhesive bonding ...)
3.  Finishing: to achieve the right properties such as surface quality, geometrical accuracy, and mechanical properties, finishing is essential.
    -   Sanding after 3D printing
    -   Gap filling
    -   Blasting
    -   Polishing
    -   Priming and painting
