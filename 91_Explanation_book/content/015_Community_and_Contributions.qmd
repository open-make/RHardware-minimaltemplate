## Community and Contributions {#sec-community-and-contributions}

This section may be split in different categories of contributors.
For example, one can separate authors, contributors and aknowledged people.
There is presently no definition of these categories or standard way to report contributions.

\
For each contributor, you may indicate tasks performend (design, assembly, use cases contribution, documentation, paper
writing,...)

One may use a spreadsheet or a specific tool like the allcontributor bot to record contributions.
