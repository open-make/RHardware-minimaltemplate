## Community - Governance

Provide a decision-making framework to facilitate discussions and reaching a shared conclusion. In the context of software and hardware, open source projects are often as much about communication as they are about coding or building (if not more). Allow informed discussions when a particular project design has reached the end or when it is useful to update it for efficiency and sustainability.
