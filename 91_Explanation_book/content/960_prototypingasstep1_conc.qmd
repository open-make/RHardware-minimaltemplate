# How to use of the template

## When should you start ? {#sec-whenstartingdocumentation}

This template allows you to start documenting your project at the ideation phase.
While it might seem too early, it is useful when you want to present your ideas to collect feedback or even find collaborators.
This allows to make clearer what are the important aspects of your idea, and can start interesting discussions.

### If you have a prototype {#sec-if-you-have-a-prototype}

We expect most readers will come to this documentation template when they actually already have a prototype, and are mostly interested in the documentation of the technical parts of the project (mostly what will be in the 04_hardware folder).
If you are in this situation, our advice is to go through each steps rapidely, making either short description of what you had in mind when doing the project or noting what you may have done only sub-consciously.
Look at the checklist below and the provided template "Full_Project_prototype", and go rapidly through it to get to the prototyping phase early.
When you are happy with the results, go back to the things you noted earlier and see what is still relevant.
For example, the needs and actors analysis may help you find or define a target group for your hardware, and help you find your users, and the conceptualisation documentation may help discussion with contributors.

# Step 1 Ideation

### Ideation

At this step, you want to share your idea, usually with a small number of people, and want to "test the water".

### Checklist ideation

This should all be included in the readme file:

# Step 2 Needs analysis {.unnumbered}

### Needs and ecosystem analysis

Using a open source hardware canva to analyse the project may be useful at this point (defining users, contributors, communication channels, resources required).

A lot of the user analysis and the problem description part aims at the definition of the constrains and requirements for the hardware which is included in the product development part of the documentation.

It may also be time to work on community engagement.

## Step 3: Concept development {.unnumbered}

### Concept development

After having an idea and defining the problems, now is time to look at putative solution.
This step aims at researching the technology that will be best adapted to fulfill the requirement and constrains.

If possible, one should try to define the **Modular architecture** of the hardware, which describes **architecture of functions and instructions of the product**.

An important part of this step is the research of similar project.
You may end up joining an existing community and extending (adding a new module) or adapting an (or combining several) existing open hardware solutions.

Usually, this step ends with a redefinition of the needs and vision, and the three first steps often are iteratively determined until a concept is chosen for the first prototype.

> Durability and repairability constrains should be included at this point of the design.
> While this will be mostly documented in step 5 with repair and dissassembly instructions, these concepts should be incorporated early in the design.

### FBS design methodology

The concept phase is the main design phase of the hardware.
While in practice, it is often made in parallel to the prototyping, larger project should invest some time at this step, and the use of the Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) design approach will facilitate future co-design:

-   **Function (F)** stands for **“what the object is for”.**
-   **Behaviour (B)** stands for **“what the object does”.**
-   **Structure (S)** stands for **“what the object consists of”.**

## Step 4: product development and prototyping {.unnumbered}

### Prototyping

Here the work on the design starts!
Continuous documentation of choice made, successes and failuress are welcome, so this step has an iterative components: with every development can come specific documentation.

In addition, the documentation may need to be performed for different parts (or modules) of the hardware.

Importantly, the Product design, manufacturing and assembling instruction may be organised using different strategies.
Some projects may write simple text files like the rest of the documentation; other projects may using Gitbuilding to write the assembly instruction, and deriving the bill of material from it; other projects may derive assembly instructions from their CAD files.

This step is also divided in two: a preparatory phase defining the main components and an iterative phase which can change with the different version of the hardware.
