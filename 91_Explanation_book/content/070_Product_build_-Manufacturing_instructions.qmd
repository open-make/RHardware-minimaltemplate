# Product build: Manufacturing sequence {#sec-product-build-manufacturing-instructions}
 

The Manufacturing sequences refer to step-by-step machining and manufacturing processes in a target-oriented arrangement to enable manufacturing.

        -   The machining sequence should define for the manufacturing of each part.
        -   Process parameters are all those parameters that are inherent to any machining operation and should have a suitable finite value to smooth and efficient removal of materials.
        -   Manufacturing standard file formats support some of the manufacturing processes and the surface geometry of a design without the possibility of modification.


      
## What does include the documentation of manufacturing sequences and instructions?
 
  1. Name of the related machine of each step
  2. Describing step by step sequence of the machining process
    - Machine
    - Type of operation
    - Tools description 
    - Process parameters of each machining operation
       - Process parameters of 3D printing
       - Process parameters of Laser cutting
       - Process parameters of CNC machines such as Lathe, Milling, etc.
       - Process parameters of arc welding
    - Raw material (including size if relevant)
    - Manufacturing files (STL, SVG or G-code, ...)
       - CAD files in an interchange format such as STL that is suitable for 3D printing 
       - Nominal geometry and its allowable variation by using symbolic language on 2D drawings like SVG, JPEG, and PDF format that is suitable for laser cutting
       - Manufacturing export formats such as G-code, STEP-NC is suitable for CNC machining
       - Circuit board design formats such as Gerber RS-274X, excellon that is suitable for vector photoplotters 2D mechanical NC machines
