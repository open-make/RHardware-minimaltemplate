## Step 3: Concept development

After having an idea and defining the problems, now is time to look at putative solution. This step aims at researching the technology that will be best adapted to fulfill the requirement and constrains.

An important part of this step is the research of similar project. You may end up joining an existing community and extending or adapting an existing open hardware.

Usually, this step ends with a redefinition of the needs and vision, and the three first steps often are iteratively determined until a concept is chosen for the first prototype. 

> Durability and repairability constrains should be included at this point of the design. While this will be mostly documented in step 5 with repair and dissassembly instructions, these concepts should be incorporated early in the design.
