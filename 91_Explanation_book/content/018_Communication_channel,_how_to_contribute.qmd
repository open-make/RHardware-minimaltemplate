## Communication channel, how to contribute {#sec-communication-channel-how-to-contribute}

Indicate how discussion are run in the community (email to maintainer, email list, forum, social media, direct communication,...)

In first step, this can be restricted to give an email where newcomers can ask for further information.
If you are using a Git Forge, the issue system of the forge may be linked here.

In developed project, a forum page or the use of a community communication tool like mattermost or matrix (to give two open source examples) is often better, as the community can work decentralized.
